        How exactly did the Carthaginian general Hannibal and his elephants
        reach Italy?
      </h3>
    </header>
    <p>
      Having battled their deadly rivals the <i>Romans</i> in <b>Spain</b>, in
      218BC the <i>Carthaginian</i> army made a move that no one expected. Their
      commander <i>Hannibal</i> marched his troops, including cavalry and
      African war elephants, across a high pass in the Alps to strike at
      <i></i>Rome itself from the north of the <b>Italian peninsula</b>. It was
      one of the greatest military feats in history.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Romans had presumed that the Alps created a secure natural barrier
      against invasion of their homeland. They hadn’t reckoned with Hannibal’s
      boldness. In December he smashed apart the Roman forces in the north,
      assisted by his awesome elephants, the tanks of classical warfare. Many of
      the animals died of cold or disease the following winter, but Hannibal
      fought his way down through Italy. For 15 years he ravaged the land,
      killing or wounding over a million citizens but without taking Rome. But
      when he faced the Roman general Scipio Africanus at Zama in north Africa
      in 202BC, his strategic genius met its match. So ended the second Punic
      war, with Rome the victor.

            Ravioli are a type of pasta comprising a filling enveloped in thin
            pasta dough. Usually served in broth or with a sauce, they
            originated as a traditional food in Italian cuisine. Ravioli are
            commonly square, though other forms are also used, including
            circular and semi-circular.
